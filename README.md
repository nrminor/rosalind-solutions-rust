# Solutions to Rosalind Problems in Rust

[![Rust CI](https://github.com/nrminor/rust-rosalind-solutions/actions/workflows/rust-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nrminor/rust-rosalind-solutions/actions/workflows/rust-ci.yml)

Solutions to each problem will be committed gradually here and will be accessible via a command line interface, e.g.:

```bash
ros_rs dna -i <ROSALIND FILE>
```

Like with my Python solutions to these problems, I have a series of goals for these solutions that might make them more complicated than the minimum viable solutions. Those goals include:

1. At minimum, practice Rust!
2. Learn to implement bioinformatic and other common algorithms myself in a memory-efficient manner.
3. Practice command-line interface design with `clap`.
4. Practice unit-testing and docs-generation with `cargo`.
5. Practice using the Helix editor, falling back to Zed when needed.
